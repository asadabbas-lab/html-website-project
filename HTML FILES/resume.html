            <h3>#1.Choose a resume format carefully.</h3>
            <p>In 99% of the cases, we recommend the chronological format.After all, recruiters first notice how your resume looks, rather than what it contains. So, this is your best chance to make a great first impression.</p>
         </section>
         <section class="spoint">
            <h3>#2.Add the right contact details.</h3>
            <p>Leave your headshot out and make sure to include your job title, a professional email address, and relevant links (e.g. your LinkedIn profile, online portfolio, website, etc.)</p>
         </section>
         <section class="tpoint">
            <h3>#3.Write an impactful resume summary.</h3>
            <p>Unless you’re an entry-level professional, always go for a resume summary (also known as a career summary). Done right, it’s your chance to get hiring managers to go through the rest of your resume in detail. </p>

         <section class="fopoint">
            <h3>#4.Pay attention to your work experience section.</h3>
            <p>Take your work experience section from OK-ish to exceptional by tailoring it to the job ad, making your achievements quantifiable, and using action verbs and power words. </p>
         </section> 
         <section class="fipoint">
            <h3>#5.Add the right skills for the job. </h3>

         <section class="sipoint">
            <h3>#6.Keep your education short and to the point.</h3>
            <p>Your most recent and highest degree is more than enough for a strong education section. We recommend making a more detailed education section only if you’re a recent graduate with barely any work experience.</p>

         <section class="sepoint">
            <h3>#7.Take advantage of optional resume sections.</h3>
            <p>Optional sections like languages, hobbies, certifications, independent projects, and the sorts, can be what sets you apart from other candidates with similar skills and experience.</p>
